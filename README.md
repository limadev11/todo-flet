# todo-flet
A cross-platform task management app built with Flet (Python) for the frontend and PHP + MySQL for the backend. Users can create, view, and mark tasks as completed. The app communicates with a REST API built in PHP, storing data in a MySQL database, and uses Flet's responsive interface for a clean user experience.
